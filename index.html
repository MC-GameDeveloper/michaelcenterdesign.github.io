        We are taught Mathematics as if it were a ruleset that governs all  
        science, and logic. We treat it as a cold and unfeeling force
        that is best left to the 'rational thinkers', and it is this approach that keeps us, non-mathematicians, 
        from appreciating the art and beauty within it.
        <br>
        <br>
        Math is a rich and complicated language used to understand 
        the world around us. A Sine wave can 
        be used to describe the motion of our body as we walk, the creation of an oil painting
        can be understood through the lense of mathematics, and even music for many years was viewed as
        a field of mathematics. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The idea of rational vs. irrational, left brain vs right brain, or math vs. art is a barrier 
        that we have placed upon ourselves that not only prevents us from experiencing the full creative potential
        of both math and art, but has also helped to develop gaps of inequality in the fields of 
        Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). 
        <br>
        <br>
        [ERR]rational uses Trigonometry to mathematically generate pieces 
        of artwork to show the absurdity of the seperation between math and art.

    <div class="center-white weight200size14"><p>FUN FACT: When 
      playing the audio the variable "t" refers to time in seconds based 
      on when you opened this site.<br> This means that you will experience
      a different sounds at different times.<br>
      It's music that changes based on the time of day.

        So, what did we just experience?
      </h2>
    </div> 
    <p>
      In short we experienced mathematics. Since math is just a form 
      of communication, this can be seen as a translation. Sin, Cos, 
      and PI are not defined by mathematics. They are mere symbols 
      of explaining relationships that exist within the world. 
      [ERR]rational just uses shapes and sounds to express those 
      relationships.
    </p>

    <div class="center-white  weight200size14">
      <p >
        <br>
        As I explain how this works, it is important to note that 
        I am not a mathematician.<br>
         I am a creative technologist
        trying to express the unity between art and math. Many<br>
        of the decisions I have made are with artistic intent, and not
        with mathematical reasoning.       
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "center-white">
      <h2>
        So, how was it made?
      </h2>
    </div> 
    <p>
      The audio and and visuals went through different 'translation' filters.<br>
      <br><strong>The Visuals</strong>:<br>
      Modeled using the Cinema 4D function spline. This allows you to draw a line
      following a certain equation for a number of "steps" or the variable t.
       For example the function Sin(t) with 4 steps. On the first 
      step t = 1 means Sin(1) which is about .8, and then on the second step t = 2 
      and Sin(2) is about .9, and so on. In my models I used the equations seen above, with 44
      steps.
      <br>
      <br><strong>The Audio</strong>:<br>
      For audio, the functions went through a more complex translation process than our 3d models.
      With the Tone.js library I loop my audio at 180 beats per minute. On each beat I calculate 
      the value of the equation with "t" equaling time in seconds and use that value as a frequency
      that is then filtered through a synthesizer. The synthesizer is just a another calculation
      applied to that number to create something more akin to a musical note.  
      <br>
      <br><strong>In Conclusion</strong>:<br>
      Each aspect of this experience has been mathematically generated. From a 3D environment 
      that allows you to explore different sculptural pieces to the generated audio. This
      isn't to show that math isn't complicated, but instead express the richness and potential
      that it has. In class rooms we ask students to measure the distance of a trees shadow based
      on it's height, and they are left confused as to why will they need to know this information. 
      We champion math as a pure, unfeeling and completely rational form of logic. Presenting math in this way
      dissuades those who are generalized as "irrational" from engaging in a field that may bring them joy. 
      Our current approach to mathematics has robbed many from its beauty, and it is my hope that through
      this experience you too can see that we must bring creativity to the world of mathematics.
