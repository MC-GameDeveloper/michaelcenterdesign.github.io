        The Mars Two project began as an inquiry into cultural adaptability
        by means of a speculative future. It ended as a grounded case study in
        <b>listening</b>.
      </p>

      <h2>Part 1: The Original Inquiry</h2>
      <p>
        The original goal of the Mars Two project was to explore humans'
        ability to adapt to new cultural circumstances.
        We conducted this thought experiment through an imagined world of
        interplanetary human civilization, where our job as designers
        was to aid interplanetary migrants.
      </p>

      <p>In this imagined world,
        population experts forecast a 50 year limit to human population on Earth.
        The only viable option for sustaining the human species is to fully
        transition to Mars. A few small, exploratory settlements are
        already established on Mars, including Mars Two— the successor
        to a failed Mars One mission. 
      </p>

      <p>
        By building this world, we presented several questions.
        <ul>
          <li>What might this mass interplanetary migration look like?</li>
          <li>Beyond logistics, what cultural, emotional, psycological
            challenges might humans face?</li>
          <li>Which challenges are distinct to interplanetary migration,
            and which have we seen before?</li>
          <li>How might we intervene to ease these challenges?</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        From these original questions, we began thinking about the particular
        challenge of Martian timekeeping and what it would mean for an
        Earthling to adapt to a new system.
        <br><br>
        We were not interested in the "information" challenges related to time
        (e.g. how to track flight patterns or send bits of data accurately).
        Instead, we were interested in the cultural, emotional, and psychological
        task of adapting to a new social construct; specifically, one as fundamental as time.
      <p>

      <p>As a means of exploring this question, we began designing materials
        that would teach the Earth-to-Mars migrants the fundamentals of
        metric timekeeping as it could exist on Mars.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Part 2: The Lesson</h2>
      <p>When we began writing our education materials, we did so with
        a particular hope: that learners would
        be able to adapt to the new system through immersion;
        our primary job, we thought, was to <i>explain the system</i>
        in logical terms that did not depend on specific
        Earth references.
        <br></br>
        For example, we presented one Martian <u>day</u> as a <u>full rotation of
        Mars about its axis</u> or <u>1,000 'beats'</u>. By design, this
        explanation made no reference to the more familiar concepts of
        an Earth day, hour, or second.

              course that all Earth-to-Mars migrants will take. This image shows
              an imagined syllabus for this course.

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="gallery-row">
      <p>
        From our play testing, one pattern emerged:
        <p class="excerpt">
            Tester: <i>But how long is a day?</i><br>
            Administrator: <i>1,000 beats.</i><br>
            Tester: <i>Yeah, but how long is that?</i><br>
            Administrator: <i>It's one rotation of the planet.</i><br>
            Tester: <i>Yeah, but...</i>
        </p>
        As adminstrators, we knew what the testers were asking.
        They wanted to know how long a
        Martian day was <i>in Earth terms</i>. They wanted to map the length
        of something they felt (a schoolday, a night's sleep, a lunch break) to a Martian beat.
        This unit translation was exactly what we'd planned to avoid.
        <br><br>
        After resisting this question multiple times, it became clear
        that this question <i>was</i> the important moment.
        We'd hit an insight, it just wasn't the one we planned to hit.
        It might have even been the opposite.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the case of timekeeping, our testing suggests
        that mental models of time are not only (or even primarily) based
        on a planetary scale. They appear to be based on daily, sensory experiences.
        Asking a person to jump out of this footing towards something more abstract is a difficult ask.
        <br><br>
        If we want to intervene in order to aid cultural adaption, as was
        our original goal, then this experience shows us that
        it is worth first understanding the meaningful points of reference
        from which people come.
        <br><br>Presenting an internally logically sound alternative
        does not sufficiently avoid the question: 'Yeah, but what does this mean for <i>me</i>?'
        Nor should that be the goal.

      </div>
      <p><b>Deimos</b> is a native born Martian. He is 40 (Martian) years old and works as an accountant 
        for the Mars Two organization. He is content with his life, and is happy in his
        daily and weekly routines. Deimos maintains his civic duties of attending regularly 
        scheduled community council meetings, and participating in weekly resources reclamation 
        to maintain stability and sustainability throughout the Mars colony.
      </p>
      <p><b>Jane</b> is an Earth native who has been brought to Mars as part of a
        joint Earth/Mars Two effort to analyzse the potential risks of
        extreme population growth on Mars and prepare for a new wave of migration.
        A specialist in resource management, Jane's technical insights are
        valuable, but do her accolades translate? Where do they fall short?
      </p>
      <p>
        From these personae emerge a tension. The Mars Two settlement
        has survived specifically because of its cautious and rigorously
        planned choices: they are a small settlement, have remained political
        neutral, and have grown safely within the limits of carefully
        forecasted resources. Thier culture is one of stability and predictability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Are they ready to welcome a new wave of migrants? How do they welcome
        Jane-- the face of this pending affront to their stability and predictability?

        <div class ="gallery-col-half"> 
          <p><b>Preferred</b></p>
          <p>Referencing U.S. legislation from the early 20th century we developed a Resources Reclamation Incentive. Similar to the Agriculture
            Adjustment Act this incentive would purchase resource surplus at market price, subsidize the resources producers, and aid newcomers
            in producing their own recources. The intent of this would be to prepare a surplus of food to mitigate a sudden influx of 
            population, while developing a positive feedback loop that means  more citizens equals greater resource production.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class ="gallery-col-half">
          <p><b>Probable</b></p>
          <p>Researching how major nations are currently struggling with the refugee crisis we discovered that cultural differences among the 
            population was one of the main sources of tension and hostility. In response to this we developed a Cultural Assimilation program that Earthlings would take part in
            during the 150-300 day journey from Earth to Mars. This curriculum would be designed to aid in the integration of a new culture
            and system, and assuage any conflict between the different groups.

      <div class ="gallery-row">
        <div class ="gallery-col-half"> 
          <p><b>Plausible</b></p>
          <p>Emulating New York City's Ellis Island, we thought of a Cultural Exchange Center. This would not be a building for filtering people in and out,
            but instead would be a place to allow for Martians and Earthlings to come together. There will be medical and governmental facilities to aid
            in the processing of the newcomers, but the main intention would be a symbol to welcome everyone.

        <div class ="gallery-col-half"> 
          <p><b>Possible</b></p>
          <p>Going to an extreme we dveloped a system that would be implemented on Earth. This would collect everyone's genetic material and through
            an algorithm an AI would maintain the perfect balance of population, and would give birth to new people using the given genetic material.
