        We are taught Mathematics as if it were a ruleset that governs all  
        science, and logic. We treat it as a cold and unfeeling force
        that is best left to the 'rational thinkers', and it is this approach that keeps us, non-mathematicians, 
        from appreciating the art and beauty within it.
        <br>
        <br>
        Math is a rich and complicated language used to understand 
        the world around us. A Sine wave can 
        be used to describe the motion of our body as we walk, the creation of an oil painting
        can be understood through the lense of mathematics, and even music for many years was viewed as
        a field of mathematics. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The idea of rational vs. irrational, left brain vs right brain, or math vs. art is a barrier 
        that we have placed upon ourselves that not only prevents us from experiencing the full creative potential
        of both math and art, but has also helped to develop gaps of inequality in the fields of 
        Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). 
        <br>
        <br>
        [ERR]rational uses Trigonometry to mathematically generate pieces 
        of artwork to show the absurdity of the seperation between math and art.

      <!-- <h2>Part 1: The Original Inquiry</h2>
      <p>
        The original goal of the Mars Two project was to explore humans'
        ability to adapt to new cultural circumstances.
        We conducted this thought experiment through an imagined world of
        interplanetary human civilization, where our job as designers
        was to aid interplanetary migrants.
      </p>

      <p>In this imagined world,
        population experts forecast a 50 year limit to human population on Earth.
        The only viable option for sustaining the human species is to fully
        transition to Mars. A few small, exploratory settlements are
        already established on Mars, including Mars Twoâ€” the successor
        to a failed Mars One mission. 
      </p>

      <p>
        By building this world, we presented several questions.
        <ul>
          <li>What might this mass interplanetary migration look like?</li>
          <li>Beyond logistics, what cultural, emotional, psycological
            challenges might humans face?</li>
          <li>Which challenges are distinct to interplanetary migration,
            and which have we seen before?</li>
          <li>How might we intervene to ease these challenges?</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        From these original questions, we began thinking about the particular
        challenge of Martian timekeeping and what it would mean for an
        Earthling to adapt to a new system.
        <br><br>
        We were not interested in the "information" challenges related to time
        (e.g. how to track flight patterns or send bits of data accurately).
        Instead, we were interested in the cultural, emotional, and psychological
        task of adapting to a new social construct; specifically, one as fundamental as time.
      <p>

      <p>As a means of exploring this question, we began designing materials
        that would teach the Earth-to-Mars migrants the fundamentals of
        metric timekeeping as it could exist on Mars.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Part 2: The Lesson</h2>
      <p>When we began writing our education materials, we did so with
        a particular hope: that learners would
        be able to adapt to the new system through immersion;
        our primary job, we thought, was to <i>explain the system</i>
        in logical terms that did not depend on specific
        Earth references.
        <br></br>
        For example, we presented one Martian <u>day</u> as a <u>full rotation of
        Mars about its axis</u> or <u>1,000 'beats'</u>. By design, this
        explanation made no reference to the more familiar concepts of
        an Earth day, hour, or second.
      </p>

            <p class="img-text">Timetelling is the first unit for a week's long
              course that all Earth-to-Mars migrants will take. This image shows
              an imagined syllabus for this course.
            </p>

        <div class="gallery-col-half-right">

            <p class="img-text">An infographic displays necessary information

      </div>
      <div class="gallery-row">
        <p>
          From our play testing, one pattern emerged:
          <p class="excerpt">
              Tester: <i>But how long is a day?</i><br>
              Administrator: <i>1,000 beats.</i><br>
              Tester: <i>Yeah, but how long is that?</i><br>
              Administrator: <i>It's one rotation of the planet.</i><br>
              Tester: <i>Yeah, but...</i>
          </p>
          As adminstrators, we knew what the testers were asking.
          They wanted to know how long a
          Martian day was <i>in Earth terms</i>. They wanted to map the length
          of something they felt (a schoolday, a night's sleep, a lunch break) to a Martian beat.
          This unit translation was exactly what we'd planned to avoid.
          <br><br>
          After resisting this question multiple times, it became clear
          that this question <i>was</i> the important moment.
          We'd hit an insight, it just wasn't the one we planned to hit.
          It might have even been the opposite.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the case of timekeeping, our testing suggests
          that mental models of time are not only (or even primarily) based
          on a planetary scale. They appear to be based on daily, sensory experiences.
          Asking a person to jump out of this footing towards something more abstract is a difficult ask.
          <br><br>
          If we want to intervene in order to aid cultural adaption, as was
          our original goal, then this experience shows us that
          it is worth first understanding the meaningful points of reference
          from which people come.
          <br><br>Presenting an internally logically sound alternative
          does not sufficiently avoid the question: 'Yeah, but what does this mean for <i>me</i>?'
          Nor should that be the goal.
