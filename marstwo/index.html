      <p class="summary">Exploring <b>cultural adaptability</b> through an imagined world of
        interplanetary human civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the symbolic structures we use to measure time to the
        nuanced ways we greet each other, this project explores socially learned
        constructs. It does so in a dramatic way: by splitting humans between Earth
        and Mars and asking them to interact.
      <p>
      <p>In this imagined world of interplanetary human civilization,
        population experts forecast a 50 year limit to human population on Earth.
        The only currently viable option for sustaining the human species is to fully
        transition to Mars. A few small, exploratory settlements are
        already established on Mars, including Mars Two-- the successor
        to a failed Mars One mission.
        </p>
        <p>
          By building up this world, we ask:
          <ul>
              <li>What might this mass <i>interplanetary</i> migration look like?</li>
              <li>Beyond logistics, what cultural, emotional, psycological
                challenges might humans face?</li>
              <li>Which challenges are
                distinct to interplanetary migration, and which have we seen before?</li>
              <li>How might we intervene to ease these challenges?</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </p>

    <h2>From self to governing rules: meet Deimos and Jane</h2>

          <p class="img-text">From individuals to large-scale governing forces:
            an ecological model of Mars Two
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p><b>Deimos</b> is a native born Martian. He is 40 (Martian) years old and works as an accountant 
        for the Mars Two organization. He is content with his life, and is happy in his
        daily and weekly routines. Deimos maintains his civic duties of attending regularly 
        scheduled community council meetings, and participating in weekly resources reclamation 
        to maintain stability and sustainability throughout the Mars colony.
      </p>
      <p><b>Jane</b> is an Earth native who has been brought to Mars as part of a
        joint Earth/Mars Two effort to analyzse the potential risks of
        extreme population growth on Mars and prepare for a new wave of migration.
        A specialist in resource management, Jane's technical insights are
        valuable, but do her accolades translate? Where do they fall short?
      </p>
      <p>
        From these personae emerge a tension. The Mars Two settlement
        has survived specifically because of its cautious and rigorously
        planned choices: they are a small settlement, have remained political
        neutral, and have grown safely within the limits of carefully
        forecasted resources. Thier culture is one of stability and predictability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Are they ready to welcome a new wave of migrants? How do they welcome
        Jane-- the face of this pending affront to their stability and predictability?

        <div class ="gallery-col-half"> 
          <p><b>Preferred</b></p>
          <p>Referencing U.S. legislation from the early 20th century we developed a Resources Reclamation Incentive. Similar to the Agriculture
            Adjustment Act this incentive would purchase resource surplus at market price, subsidize the resources producers, and aid newcomers
            in producing their own recources. The intent of this would be to prepare a surplus of food to mitigate a sudden influx of 
            population, while developing a positive feedback loop that means  more citizens equals greater resource production.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class ="gallery-col-half">
          <p><b>Probable</b></p>
          <p>Researching how major nations are currently struggling with the refugee crisis we discovered that cultural differences among the 
            population was one of the main sources of tension and hostility. In response to this we developed a Cultural Assimilation program that Earthlings would take part in
            during the 150-300 day journey from Earth to Mars. This curriculum would be designed to aid in the integration of a new culture
            and system, and assuage any conflict between the different groups.

      <div class ="gallery-row">
        <div class ="gallery-col-half"> 
          <p><b>Plausible</b></p>
          <p>Emulating New York City's Ellis Island, we thought of a Cultural Exchange Center. This would not be a building for filtering people in and out,
            but instead would be a place to allow for Martians and Earthlings to come together. There will be medical and governmental facilities to aid
            in the processing of the newcomers, but the main intention would be a symbol to welcome everyone.
          </p>  
        </div>
        <div class ="gallery-col-half"> 
          <p><b>Possible</b></p>
          <p>Going to an extreme we dveloped a system that would be implemented on Earth. This would collect everyone's genetic material and through
            an algorithm an AI would maintain the perfect balance of population, and would give birth to new people using the given genetic material.

          <h2>Test 1</h2>
          <p>We initially tested a course syllabus for teaching
            the ways of Martian life.

          <h4>The questions we wanted answered were:</h4>

          <h4>What we learned:
            </h4>
          <p>This experience taught us that the project was still too vague. The feedback
            ranged from different topics such as safety precautions to necessary technologies. 
          </p>
          <p>Moving forward we focused into a specific part of the education process. 
            Allowing us to explore the minutiae of the students needs when making such 
            and extreme transition.

          <p>Through our exploration thus far, we have concluded that when taking people out

            reality. This is not only to provide a reference point, but also allow for the comfort
            and familiarity of what is known.

              The course has three units: Logistics, Civics, and History. From the
              Logistics unit, students will gain an understanding of their new physical
              environment and how to orient themselves within their new setting. From the
              Civics unit, students will gain practical knowledge of the legal systems on
              Mars Two, and will be prepared to participate in civic systems. From the
              History unit, students will learn the historical context of today’s Mars Two
              settlement-- from its built infrastructure to its arts and culture.
