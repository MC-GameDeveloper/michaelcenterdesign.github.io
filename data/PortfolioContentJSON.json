Over the course of two years, I developed seven multiplayer games that facilitated conversation and interest between players. Each game had its own unique design and challenges, such as a Jigsaw puzzle game that would play a video when the puzzle was completed, this project required I create whole new asset data management system that could handle art for hundreds of different puzzles,  and a baking story telling game the incorporated Kinoo's Magic wand controller where I used an array of sensors to read gestures such as stirring, or chopping.\n<br><br>\nTo support our game development, I worked closely with the art team to create art pipelines to streamline asset development, and workflows for developing games with reusable components, which increased production efficiency by 3x and reduced asset development time by 50%. In my time there I mastered many skills including, object-oriented design principles, which I used to create reusable components and improve code maintaibility and scalability, asynchrounous code logic and multiplayer logic which was used to ensure that both players experiences the expected behavior even on the slowest network connection, 3D math to properly calculate the gesture input for the Kinoo Magic wand, and much more.",

Once connected the phone acted as a controller letting the player click buttons to rotate left/right and move the phone to swing the golf club back and forth. ",

In the game, the user uses the switches to type a letter in Morse Code and an animal with the corresponding name would appear \u201cdancing\u201d and making animal noises.

This is achieved by using trigonometry to properly angle the directional light on a circle opposed to having the sun rise/set on a perfectly vertical path. The other part is a shader that allows the developer the create realistic waves. The Wave shader uses Trochoidal or Gerstner waves to emulate the realism of actual fluid dynamics. Currently in development is a tool for designers to dictate the number of waves, and all other appropriate properties.",
